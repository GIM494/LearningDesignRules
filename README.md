# Learning Design Rules
This repository contains the code used to implement an algorithm designed to learn about design choices and implementations for a project base. There are two sections: 
  1. Archives - This contains all of the code used to develop the current methodology. It is not structured like a typical github repository because it was essentially all of the files off of a machine that is no longer in use. 
  2. Current Method - Two files outside of the Archive section that contain the program driver and functions used in the driver. Everything in this section is treated like a normal github repository, with commits to these files representing updates to the code and methodology. The proper inputs for the program and a description of the driver follow.
